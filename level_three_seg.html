                <h2>Level Three</h2>
                    <p>The Galaxy Federation has awarded you another 350 quatros. Unfortunately they are having trouble with space wyrms and will begin collecting a tax to pay them to leave. Try to purchase as many items as you can without going over your budget, but remember, you will now need at least 50 quatros of your budget for that pesky tax. You will also need to purchase at least one green item (trees, forest, grass.)</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                <p>Tip: Dragons are lovely, but dangerous. Consider buying fiery things carefully.</p>
